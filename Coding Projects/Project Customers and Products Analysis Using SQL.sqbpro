Welcome to my project, where I will perform data analysis on a collection of scale model cars to derive key performance 
indicators (KPIs) with the ultimate goal of making more informed and intelligent decisions.

In this project, we will be answering these 3 questions:

Question 1: Which products should we order more of or less of?
Question 2: How should we tailor marketing and communication strategies to customer behaviors?
Question 3: How much can we spend on acquiring new customers?

Contains eight tables:

The "productslines" table stores product category data with four columns. 
The primary key is the "product line" and it is related to the "producttable" 
through a one-to-many relationship based on the "product line" column.

The "products" table contains product information and has nine columns. 
The primary key is the "productCode" and it has a foreign key relationship with the "productlines" 
table through the "productLine" column, creating a many-to-one relationship. 
Additionally, it is related to the "orderdetails" table through a one-to-one relationship based on the 
"productCode" column.

The "orderdetails" table holds order-specific details with five columns. 
The composite key is formed by the combination of "orderNumber" and "productCode." 
It has a one-to-one relationship with the "products" table based on the "productCode" column and another 
one-to-one relationship with the "order" table based on the "orderNumber" column.

The "orders" table contains data related to received orders with seven columns. 
The primary key is the "orderNumber" and it has a foreign key relationship with the "customerNumber" 
from the "customers" table. 
This relationship is one-to-one with the "orderdetails" table based on the "orderNumber" and a 
many-to-one with the "customers" table based on the "customerNumber" column.

The "customers" table holds customer data with thirteen columns. The primary key is the "customerNumber" 
and it has a foreign key relationship with the "salesRepEmployeeNumber" from the "employees" table. 
This table has a one-to-many relationship with the "orders" table based on the "customerNumber" 
a one-to-one relationship with the "payments" table based on the "customerNumber" 
and a many-to-one relationship with the "employees" table based on the "employeeNumber" column.

The "payments" table contains payment-related information with four columns. The composite key consists of 
"customerNumber" and "checkNumber." It has a one-to-one relationship with the "customers" table based on the 
"customerNumber" column.

The "employees" table stores employee data and has eight columns. The primary key is the "employeeNumber" 
and it has a foreign key relationship with the "officeCode" from the "offices" table. 
This table has a one-to-many self-referencing relationship between "employeeNumber" and "reportsTo" columns, 
a one-to-many relationship with the "customers" table based on the "salesRepEmployeeNumber" 
and a many-to-one relationship with the "offices" table based on the "officeCode" column.

The "offices" table contains office-related data and has nine columns. The primary key is the "officeCode" 
and it has a one-to-many relationship with the "employees" table based on the "officeCode" column.*/

/*
Conclusion: 

Question 1: Which products should we order more of or less of?

Answer 1: Upon reviewing the findings and contrasting low stock with the best-performing products, 
it is evident that the classic cars category warrants frequent restocking. 
This conclusion is drawn from the fact that classic cars appear 5 times among the top 10 highest-performing 
products.

Question 2: How should we match marketing and communication strategies to customer behaviors?

Answer 2: After examining the profit generated by the top and lowest customers, 
it is recommended to implement loyalty rewards and enhanced services for the top-performing customers 
to ensure their retention. On the other hand, for the lower-performing customers, conducting surveys 
would be beneficial to gain insights into their needs and expectations from the company. 
This valuable information can be used to devise effective strategies to attract new customers.

Question 3: How Much Can We Spend on Acquiring New Customers?

Answer 3: 
With an average customer lifetime value of £39,040, we can deduce that each new customer will yield a profit 
of the same amount. With this data, the company can now plan and allocate funds for new customer acquisition.
